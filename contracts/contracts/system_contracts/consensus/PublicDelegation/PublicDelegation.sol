// Implementation of public delegation of Kaia.
//
// PublicDelegation is an non-transferable interest-bearing token based on the user's staked KAIA in baseCnStakingV3.
// It must be deployed and set as reward address of CnStakingV3.
//
// The balance of PublicDelegation will be increased by the block reward, not by transaction.
// The exchange ratio between pdKAIA:KAIA keeps changing over time by the block reward.
//
// Its math is mainly based on ERC4626, which is a standard for tokenized vaults.
// See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626 for more details.
